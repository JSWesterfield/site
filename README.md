# Food Oasis

This is a website with a map of food sources in Los Angeles, and list of resources about food deserts and health. You can view the site here…
https://foodoasis.la

## How to make changes

The website is published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and the files are generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

As you make changes and commit/push them to GitHub, the [staging website](https://staging.foodoasis.la) will automatically update. You can also manually push your changes to the [live website](https://github.com/foodoasisla/foodoasis.la).

## How to develop locally

If you want to see a preview of your changes while you work, you can [run a Jekyll server](https://jekyllrb.com) on your local machine. [Installing Ruby and Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) is a good place to start.

Since it takes a while to generate the whole site, you may want to run Jekyll in “incremental” mode, like this…

```jekyll serve --incremental```

If you’re working outside of the locations folder, you can speed things up even more by using the development config file…

```jekyll build && jekyll serve --config _config_dev.yml --incremental```

The development config file doesn’t create or remove any of the files in these folders…

```
api/*
locations/*
community-garden/*
farmers-market/*
food-pantry/*
summer-lunch/*
supermarket/*
```

If those folders are already present, your local website should work just fine (though the files in those folders may not be the latest).

## How to add a new location

The simplest way to add a new location is using the [add form](https://foodoasis.la/add/).

If you want to add a lot of new locations, these files may help…

```
_node/create-markdown.js
_node/update-markdown.js
```

The markdown files in these folders were initially generated by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) from the data files in the `_data` folder.

```
_locations/*
_community-garden/*
_farmers-market/*
_food-pantry/*
_summer-lunch/*
_supermarket/*
```

They were created with `_node/create-markdown.js` and updated with `_node/update-markdown.js`, **but have since been edited by hand**.
