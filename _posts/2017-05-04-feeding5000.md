Food Oasis Los Angeles (FOLA) participated in Feeding the 5000, a festival that celebrates the value of food, and calls on everyone to tackle food waste. Feeding the 5000 handed out over 5000 healthy meals from recovered food to people around downtown. Raven Hardison, a FOLA team member, also had the opportunity to speak about our work.
